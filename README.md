## My Background

I'm an undergraduate student with prior exposure to basic **machine learning** and **deep learning** courses.  
This project is part of my self-study journey to deepen my understanding of systems and foundational concepts behind modern machine learning frameworks.

The code and notes in this repository reflect what I‚Äôve learned along the way ‚Äî including both successes and struggles.  
I hope that others with a similar background might find it helpful or relatable, whether you're reviewing core concepts or tackling these topics for the first time.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my code and answers from studying CMU's 15-442 (Operating Systems) and 15-642 courses.  
I am **not affiliated** with the course or Carnegie Mellon University in any way (as of Apr 5, 2025). I studied the material on my own and uploaded my work to:

- Document my learning journey
- Reflect on what I‚Äôve learned and where I‚Äôve struggled
- Share with others who may be studying similar topics

## Contents

- `slides/` ‚Äî Course materials from the official website: [https://mlsyscourse.org/materials](https://mlsyscourse.org/materials)
- `assignment*/` ‚Äî My personal solutions to the assignments.  
  Each assignment folder includes a `README` file with:
  - My understanding of the challenging parts
  - Problems I encountered while solving them
  - Notes on how I approached the issues (some solved, some still confusing)

Feel free to explore, and you're very welcome to discuss and learn together!
